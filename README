This example program shows how to use the Gstreamer library to 
create an RTP/RTCP video streamer on i.MX6 boards, though it 
could easily be used on other platforms by changing some of the
elements used for capture, encode, decode, and playback.

They makes use of a TCP socket to control the link.

The program is licensed with the GNU Public License, version 2.

Hardware Dependencies:
Server:
  Freescale i.MX6-based board
  Image sensor connected to and working on CSI
Client:
  x86 host
  - or -
  i.MX6-based board with LCD or HDMI monitor connected

Software Dependencies:
  Gstreamer-0.10
  gst-fsl-plugins (mfw_v4lsrc, vpuenc)
  For x86 clients, it uses the ffdec_h264, ffmpegcolorspace, and
  autovideosink elements
  For i.MX6 clients, it uses vpudec and mfw_v4lsink

To build:

1) Make sure that a cross toolchain is configured in your path.

> export CROSS_COMPILE = <cross compiler prefix will end with a dash '-'>
> make

Copy the binaries to the target filesystem using your preferred method.
(e.g. ftp, scp, copying to SDcard)
  
Start server (on target):
> glive-server

Start client (on target or host):
> glive-client -s <IP address of server>

The client should connect to the server automatically.
